# Surfs Up
## The Purpose of this analysis is to compare the differences in temperatures by month retrieved from Weather stations near Oahu.

### The following conclusions can be made from the image below, which is a statistics summary of the dataset filtered for June and December.
* There are slightly (~10%) fewer observed temps for Dec than June
* Dec lows are 8째 colder, Dec Highs are 2째 colder
* Dec temps have a range of 27째, June temps have a range of 21째

Additionally, we can see the average temp is 74(June) and 71(Dec) respectively, and the standard deviation being between 3.2 and 3.7.

### This information can lead to the conclusion the weather is very nice year-round, at least in terms of temperature.

### I further developed the analysis by adding two additional queries,
1. Provide Accumulation of Precipitation
2. Provide Addition of March and September

this information shows when it rains, it rains a lot (The month with a lot of precipitation, march, is also the month with the most NO-RAIN days).

shown below is the code to develop this information:
```
#Extra queries
# 1. Provide Accumulation of Precipitation
# 2. Provide Addition of March and September
# NOTE: a filter for just the Station 'USC00519281' was added since this is in coursework.
# *. Additionally, I included no of occurrences of NO rain

marchrain = session.query(Measurement.date, Measurement.prcp).filter(extract('month', Measurement.date)==3).filter(Measurement.station == 'USC00519281')

                    int(septraindf[septraindf["sept_precip"]==0].count()),
